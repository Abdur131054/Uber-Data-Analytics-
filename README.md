# Uber-Data-Analytics
## Introduction 
In this data engineering endeavor, I successfully executed a comprehensive project leveraging the robust capabilities of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to handle and analyze a substantial dataset from Uber. The project seamlessly unfolded through various stages, demonstrating a well-orchestrated workflow from data storage to insightful visualization.
Tools and technology I used:

- Google Cloud Storage: Commencing with the establishment of a solid foundation, I efficiently stored the Uber dataset in Google Cloud Storage., a reliable and scalable cloud storage solution.
- Python: Subsequently, I devised and implemented sophisticated transformation logic using Python, a versatile programming language widely employed in data engineering tasks.
- Mage: To streamline the entire data processing pipeline, I harnessed the power of , an open-source data pipeline tool.
- Google BigQuery: The journey continued with the loading of processed data into Google BigQuery, a robust and highly scalable data warehouse within the GCP ecosystem.
- SQL queries: Within the expansive capabilities of BigQuery, I further conducted in-depth analysis using , unraveling valuable insights from the Uber dataset.
- Looker Studio: As the culmination of this data engineering endeavor, I utilized  to create a dynamic and visually engaging dashboard.
